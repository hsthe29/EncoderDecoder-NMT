# Neural Machine Translation

# Overview
Implementation and deployment of the machine translation application as a web application

This app has 3 Machine Translation models:
1. RNN based (LSTM): **Available**
2. Transformer: **Available**
3. Graph NN: In **development**

# Deployment
I deployed the application in a very simple way on my local machine using the `http` library

Basical usage: Run the following command with terminal:

    `$ sh .\start-app.sh` (Windows) or `$ start-app.sh` (Linux) 

# Project Descriptions
## Dataset
I used [PhoMT](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoMT) from VinAIResearch for this project. For more information about PhoMT, Please click on the link I placed in the previous line. 

## Model
### 1. Using RNN

### 2. Transformer 

### 3. Graph NN


## Training and Inference
Visit each model's [folder](thehs/model) to see the training and inference results.

## BLEU Score
